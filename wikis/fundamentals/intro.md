## Introduction
Documentation should be as important to a developer as all other facets of development.

No matter what you are developing, chances are that some day you or one of your colleagues will have to revisit it. When that day comes, you will not remember so vividly what you wrote and why.

And if you do remember, there may be some edge cases or specific uses which may not be clearly apparent. The obvious solution is documentation.

Taking that extra time to write a proper description of what you worked on will save huge amounts of time in the future.

As a member of our group, you are highly encourage to document your codes using our wiki.

## How to write good documentation
Good documentation is like a good block of code. Short, simple, and easy to understand. Here are a few guidelines you can follow:
- Understand who the documentation is aimed at. Is it only for developers? Is there a broader audience? Understanding this will save you time, since you will know up front how much to elaborate in your explanations.
- Write a short, but descriptive background explaining the main points of what you built. This will help readers understand the purpose of the feature and ascertain its relevance to what they want to know.
- List and describe the main perspectives of your feature, making sure to point out any dependencies that exist with other features.
- Make sure there is a timestamp, to tell readers the validity of the documentation. Also, if you are using certain libraries, be sure to include their versions as well.
- Be generous with your coding examples, detailing how to properly use the feature you wrote and showcase the expected results.
